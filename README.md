# Faune
wildlife training project
It's a project to learn HTML CSS and also JavaScript
In the first part of this project I put a lot of HTML, CSS and also JS in my code 
So this is a static website and not an interactive website because there is no PHP or MySql to manage user requests and for making database for example.
